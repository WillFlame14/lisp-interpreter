# lisp-interpreter
A basic interpreter for a custom Lisp.

## Getting Started

First, install [bun](https://bun.sh/).

`bun start [path]` will interpret a file. If a file path is not provided, an interactive REPL will be opened.

Dependencies are only for assisting with local development and can be installed with `bun install`.
